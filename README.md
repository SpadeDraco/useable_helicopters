# useful_helicopters
A Cataclysm DDA mod that rebalances helicopters to make them more practical. Has recently undergone a complete overhaul to make it compatible with 0.F and address issues with the initial (extremely hacky) release.

Currently does the following things:
-Reduces fuel cost of turbine engines. This allows most helicopters to operate for 4-6 hours instead of the default 20 minutes.

-Adds the Airframe and Powerplant Mechanic trait to all pilot professions. This allows all pilots to repair and modify helicopters freely.

-Makes Rotors repairable and salvageable. Yes this means you can put them on your Secuirty Van. They have weight limits though so they probably won't be able to lift it.

-Makes the "Helicopter Pilot" and "Airframe and Powerplant Mechanic" proficiencies learnable. (Unfinished. No recipes teach them yet.)


Future plans in order of priority:

#1. Add a decently common bionic that gives the "Helicopter Pilot" and "A&P Mechanic" proficiencies.

#2. Write up a FAQ that goes into detail on all Helicopter mechanics. Little is explained ingame.

#3. Make Rotors craftable and capable of training the "A&P Mechanic" proficiency.

#4. Sensical way to train the piloting proficiency. (long term goal, hardcode doesn't currently support this)
